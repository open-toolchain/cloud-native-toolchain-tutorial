# DevOps Tutorial Application (In progress)

[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) promises to improve both development and operational efficiencies while enhancing partnership with customers. More than doing the same things faster, DevOps relies on establishing a good delivery pipeline spanning from ideation to monitoring. The DevOps Tutorial Application Project can get you started. It will create a new project in [IBM DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net), build it using the latest tools, deploy it to [IBM Bluemix](https://bluemix.net), and lay the foundation for test, scale and operations.

The application is a simple Node.js [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/) sample you can extend to implement your new offering today. This sample code is used in a [DevOps tutorial](https://method.mybluemix.net/devops/method/category/tutorials/) that provides a guided experience through configuration of a toolchain that can be used for cloud native development in IBM DevOps Services and IBM Bluemix.  The various stages of the pipeline may require IDs, trials, or subscriptions to independent service offerings. The tutorial includes an explanation of how to get and use IDs for each service.

Create your new IBM DevOps project now!
