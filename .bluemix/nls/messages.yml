template.name: "Garage Method tutorial with Cloud Foundry"
template.description: "This toolchain demonstrates the DevOps practices featured in the IBM  Cloud Garage Method. The toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, test automation, and automated monitoring and operations. It comes with a sample app that is written in Node.js [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/), which you can further extend. This sample code is used in a [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/introduce-develop-cloud-foundry-app-toolchain) that explains how to configure a toolchain for cloud-native development.\n\nTo set up and run stages of the pipeline, you might need to register for other tools or services. The tutorial guides you through those details.\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isnâ€™t already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/introduce-develop-cloud-foundry-app-toolchain)."
template.gettingStarted: "**Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new build and deployment. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/introduce-develop-cloud-foundry-app-toolchain)  for this toolchain."
